module ActiveConformityCustomMethods



end

=begin
This file is for creating custom methods that you can add to the conformity set
of a conformable. The object that these methods will run against is availible by
calling 'obj'. Additionally, you can utilize any of the named arguments that
were saved in the conformity set.

For example:
  For a conformable with the conformity_set like:

  { method: { name: 'content_is?', arguments: {string: 'hello world' } } }

  You can define the following method in this module:

  def content_is?
    if obj.content == method_args[:string]
      return true
    else
      errors.add(:content, "does not match #{method_args[:string]}")
    end
  end

  Be sure to follow the rails convention of adding errors in the false case!
